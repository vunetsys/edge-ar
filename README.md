Managed to figure out how to update the modified the .js file containing the image-tracking        implementation. Issue was browser cache related. Also looked into the structure of the a-frame implementation of image tracking. Mostly looked into the HTML file, read up on how a-frame works, XMLHttpRequests, and also studied the overall structure.

Managed to figure out how devtools work, and how I can load the page on my android and read console values on the main development device (PC). Started looking more into the structure of the image tracking build, how parameters are set and how video's are being recorded.
